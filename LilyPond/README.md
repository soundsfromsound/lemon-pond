# ARCHIVE

This is my archive of personal LilyPond code snippets and functions. 

I've done my best to carefully curate everything here - all of these files come from either the LilyPond mailing list or from my own private collection of original files that I've created in order to fit my specific needs as a composer.

Help yourself to anything here friends. 

And please feel free to reach out with any comments, questions, or other feedback.

Be well.
