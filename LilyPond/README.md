# Archive

This is my archive of personal LilyPond code snippets and functions. 

I've carefully curated everything here - all of these files come from from my own private collection of original files that I've created in order to fit my specific needs as a composer, as well as either the LilyPond mailing list or the LilyPond Facebook group.

Help yourself to anything here friends. 

And please feel free to reach out with any comments, questions, or other feedback.

Be well.
