# Welcome to the lemonpond.

This is a collection of my personal LilyPond files.

Including:
* Code Snippets
* Frescobaldi Configurations / Color Themes
* Templates
* House Styles / Style Sheets

I will be uploading two versions of snippets: 

XML snippets (for you to import into Frescobaldi and use in your scores), and plain LilyPond syntax snippets for general reference.
If you're looking for my Solarized LilyPond color theme, it's located here in the **Frescobaldi** directory.
